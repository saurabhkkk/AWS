# Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
- It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.
- It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.
- Amazon RDS is available on several [database instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/) - optimized for memory, performance or I/O - and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including [Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/), [MariaDB](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/), [Oracle Database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/), and [SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/). You can use the [AWS Database Migration Service](https://aws.amazon.com/dms/) to easily migrate or replicate your existing databases to Amazon RDS.

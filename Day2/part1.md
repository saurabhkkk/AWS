# **LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION(Types of cloud computing services)**

The most common and widely adopted cloud computing services are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

**What is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**

IaaS is a cloud computing model where virtualized infrastructure is offered to, and managed for, businesses by external cloud providers. With IaaS, companies can outsource for storages, servers, data center space and cloud networking components connected through the internet, offering similar functionality as that of an on-premises infrastructure. Some examples of the wide usage of IaaS are automated, policy-driven operations such as backup, recovery, monitoring, clustering, internal networking, website hosting, etc.

The service provider is responsible for building the servers and storage, networking firewalls/ security, and the physical data center. Some key players offering IaaS are Amazon EC2, [Microsoft Azure](https://www.trianz.com/partnerships/cloud/microsoft-azure-cloud-services), Google Cloud Platform, GoGrid, Rackspace, DigitalOcean among others.

**What is Platform as a Service (PaaS):**

PaaS builds on IaaS. Here, cloud vendors deliver computing resources, both cloud software and hardware infrastructure components like middleware and operating systems, required to develop and test applications. The PaaS environment enables cloud users (accessing them via a webpage) to install and host data sets, development tools and business analytics applications, apart from building and maintaining necessary hardware. Some key players offering PaaS are Bluemix, CloudBees, Salesforce.com, Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS, Microsoft Azure, OpenShift, [Oracle Cloud](https://www.trianz.com/partnerships/cloud/oracle-partner), SAP and OpenShift.

**What is Software as a Service (SaaS):**

SaaS is special in that it incorporates both IaaS and Paas. Here, the cloud service provider delivers the entire software suite as a pay-per-use model. SaaS lets users easily access software applications -- such as emails -- over the internet. Most common examples of SaaS are Microsoft Office 360, AppDynamics, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google G Suite, Zoho, Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle CRM, Pardot Marketing Automation, and SAP Business ByDesign.

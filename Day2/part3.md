**HOW TO CREATE A BUCKET?**

Create bucket\&gt;Give any name to bucket suppose I give demo\&gt;Remaining things keep it

by default don&#39;t change anything\&gt;click on create bucket

It gives error as it already exists why is it so?

We had not create bucket before, Then why it is saying that it already exists

When you create bucket ,bucket name is always region wise like global

In global dropdown it will say that s3 does not require the global selection

**So, this name should be unique across the aws**

Now give the name as vita-demo-20 and click on create bucket. Now our bucket is ready

Now click on that vita-dem-20

In that we have different options:

1) create folder

2) Upload

Now lets upload some file and then click on the upload

How to make a folder?

click on create folder\&gt;give the folder name as demo \&gt;save

Now when u make the parent bucket it may have some duplicate

Our parent folder top should be the unique across the aws

Again u can create the folder or upload it is totally depends on you that how many folders do u want to create?

Here we can also host our website.

**Firewall** -Filters the network traffic

Os has firewall

**1] Inbound-**you ctrl incoming traffic

**2] Outbound**- you ctrl outgoing traffic

Search for firewall

Click on windows defender firewall security

You have inbound and outbound rules\&gt;click on inbound

In that you give the access to the ports .Now suppose you have a server on the port 80

And if we don&#39;t give access here, then from browser no one could access it

On RHS\&gt;New rule\&gt;click on the port\&gt;Next \&gt;portname-80\&gt;next\&gt;Allow the connection\&gt;Next\&gt;select all\&gt;next\&gt;demp-80-port\&gt;finish

AWS has given the cloud&#39;s firewall. They also provided inbound and outbound

So that I will be easy for the user .No need to learn the networking.

It is known as the **&quot;Security Groups&quot;**

So traffic first goes here then it goes towards the os

In aws educate website on rhs you will see the security groups in that there is a option of vita-demo-20,view inbound rules and view outbound rules

Click on vita-demo-20\&gt;In that inbound rules\&gt;Edit inbound rules\&gt;You can add or delete

What will happen bcz of that?

So in this way cloud make easy for the security purpose.
